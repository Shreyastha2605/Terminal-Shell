# Terminal-Shell
TechShell is a custom Unix-like shell written in C for the CSC 222 Systems Programming course. The program simulates the behavior of a basic Bash shell by repeatedly prompting the user for input, parsing commands, and executing them using low-level system calls such as fork(), execvp(), wait(), and dup2().
